            <h2>Job Description:</h2>
            <p>Research, design, and develop computer and network software or specialized utility programs.
                Analyze user needs and develop software solutions, applying principles and techniques of computer
                science, engineering, and mathematical analysis. Update software or enhance existing software
                capabilities. May work with computer hardware engineers to integrate hardware and software systems, and
                develop specifications and performance requirements. May maintain databases within an application area,
                working individually or coordinating database development as part of a team.

        <div id="EduReq">
            <h2>Educational requirements:</h2>
            <p>Employers typically expect in-depth coding, testing, and development knowledge, which a bachelor's degree
                can deliver. Common majors include information technology, computer science, and software engineering.
                As technology advances and the field becomes more competitive, some software developers pursue master's
                degrees to stand out among the competition.

            <h2>Safety Info:</h2>
            <p>Software development safety involves securing code against issues, and protecting personal health. You
                should take care of yourself due to the job itself being stressful, you should validate user inputs,
                manage dependencies, and automate security testing. Developers should also focus on keeping a work-life
                balance, as to not let their job take over their life.

        <div id="jobOutlook">
            <h2>Job Outlook:</h2>
            <p>Overall employment of software developers, quality assurance analysts, and testers is projected to grow
                15 percent from 2024 to 2034, much faster than the average for all occupations.

                About 129,200 openings for software developers, quality assurance analysts, and testers are projected
                each year, on average, over the decade. Many of those openings are expected to result from the need to
                replace workers who transfer to different occupations or exit the labor force, such as to retire.

                <p> In practice, organizations that empower their people with AI will outpace those who don’t, and
                    employees
                    who know how to work with AI will outperform those who do not. Most corporations have discovered
                    that
                    rather than working against AI, they should work with it to create the best environment.
